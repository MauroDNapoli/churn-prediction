# churn-prediction

## Brief description
Nowadays, it is straightforward for customers to change internet or cell phone providers. That is why Telco's companies need to keep the customer engaged and prevent them from churning.
In this project, we try to predict customer churn using supervised learning algorithms in the sci-kit learn package.

## Dataset
Dataset downloaded from Kagle: https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn

## Findings
After fitting different models with different hyperparameters combinations, we found that it is possible to predict 60% of customer churn with over 60% precision using a Gradient Boosting Classifier model.
